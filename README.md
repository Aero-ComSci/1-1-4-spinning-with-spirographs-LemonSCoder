# 1.1.4 Spirographs

*Complete the following.*

1.  Zero-iteration conditions never occur or start while infinite loops go on forever due to the fact that the condition that, when true, makes the loop run remains true.
2. [https://github.com/Aero-ComSci/1-1-4-spinning-with-spirographs-LemonSCoder/blob/main/OriginalSpiralCode.py](https://github.com/Aero-ComSci/1-1-4-spinning-with-spirographs-LemonSCoder/blob/main/OriginalSpiralCode.py)
4. [Screenshot of my Result](https://github.com/Aero-ComSci/1-1-4-spinning-with-spirographs-LemonSCoder/blob/main/images/ConcentricSquares.png) [the code](https://github.com/Aero-ComSci/1-1-4-spinning-with-spirographs-LemonSCoder/blob/main/images/SpiralCodeImage.xcf)

4. [steps 17, 18 and 19](https://github.com/Aero-ComSci/1-1-4-spinning-with-spirographs-LemonSCoder/blob/main/Steps171819.py)
5. The flowchart in Step Twenty-One represents an infinite loop within an algorithm since the loop described in the flowchart goes on forever due to the fact that the string variable answer continues to be equal to "y" throughout the program. There are no ways within the flowchart to change the value of the variable answer, and the while loop continues to run as long as the variable answer is equal to "y". Therefore, the while loop described in the flowchart will run infinitely and represents an infinite loop witihn an algorithm.
6. Insert a screenshot or picture of the algorith you used for your tokenizer on the previous activity.
7. Give an example of an undecidable problem, attach code.
