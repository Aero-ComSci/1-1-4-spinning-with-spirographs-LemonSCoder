# 1.1.4 Spirographs

---

1.  Zero-iteration conditions never occur or start while infinite loops go on forever due to the fact that the condition that, when true, makes the loop run remains true. 
2. [Solution to Spiral Code Prompt](https://github.com/Aero-ComSci/1-1-4-spinning-with-spirographs-LemonSCoder/blob/main/OriginalSpiralCode.py)

4. [Steps 17, 18 and 19](https://github.com/Aero-ComSci/1-1-4-spinning-with-spirographs-LemonSCoder/blob/main/Steps171819.py)

6. The flowchart in Step Twenty-One represents an infinite loop within an algorithm since the loop described in the flowchart goes on forever due to the fact that the string variable answer continues to be equal to "y" throughout the program. There are no ways within the flowchart to change the value of the variable answer, and the while loop continues to run as long as the variable answer is equal to "y". Therefore, the while loop described in the flowchart will run infinitely and represents an infinite loop witihn an algorithm.

8. An undecidable problem means that no algorithm can be created to solve the aforementioned problem and no algorithm created for this problem can give an exact "Yes" or "No" answer for the problem (no matter the input). (ex. adding one to the positive number a user inputs continuously without a way to stop the program at a certain point)
